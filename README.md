# LeetCode Solutions

A curated collection of my **LeetCode problem solutions**, created to strengthen my skills in **algorithms, data structures, and clean code practices**.

This repository reflects my approach to problem solving, code quality, and performance optimization.

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Here

- Well-structured and readable solutions
- Focus on correctness, efficiency, and clarity
- Problems solved progressively from easy to hard

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each problem is organized in its own directory:

```
leetcode/
├── twoSum/
│ └── twoSum.cpp
├── validParentheses/
│ └── validParentheses.cpp
```

Each folder may contain:
- Solution source code
- Short explanation (when needed)
- Time and space complexity analysis

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings  
- Hash Tables  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees & Graphs
